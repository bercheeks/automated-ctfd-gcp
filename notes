Using custom domains might add noticeable latency to responses that App Engine sends to your app's users in some regions.
	App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications. If you want to use an IP address that only maps to your domain then you should instead set up a load balancer with App Engine. This may mitigate a domain fronting issue in which a request to application A in the SNI certificate may be routed to application B in the HTTP Host header.


**A network endpoint group (NEG) specifies a group of backend endpoints for a load balancer. A serverless NEG is a backend that points to a Cloud Run, App Engine, Cloud Functions, or API Gateway service.
	-Serverless NEGs allow you to use Google Cloud serverless apps with external HTTP(S) Load Balancing. After you configure a load balancer with the serverless NEG backend, requests to the load balancer are routed to the serverless app backend.

	




- Building the Container
		- CLone the git repo into the shells local dir
		- Cloud Build
			- package source code into containers
			- build the Dockerfile image and push it out to container registry
			- container registry is googles private hub

			- enable Google CLoud Build
			*************************
				- "gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleleapis.com"

			- "gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/boxofbowties:1.0.0 . "
				- pushes image to registry
				- make sure you are choosing the dir with the dockerfile
